* Marvell MV64XXX I2C controller

Required properties :

 - reg             : Offset and length of the register set for the device
 - compatible      : Should be "allwinner,sun4i-i2c", or "marvell,mv64xxx-i2c"
and "marvell,mv7230-i2c" for controller which support the I2C Transaction
Generator
 - interrupts      : The interrupt number

Optional properties :

 - clock-frequency : Desired I2C bus clock frequency in Hz. If not set the
default frequency is 100kHz

Examples:

	i2c@11000 {
		compatible = "marvell,mv64xxx-i2c";
		reg = <0x11000 0x20>;
		interrupts = <29>;
		clock-frequency = <100000>;
	};

For a controller which support the I2C Transaction Generator:

	i2c@11000 {
		compatible = "marvell,mv78230-i2c", "marvell,mv64xxx-i2c";
		reg = <0x11000 0x100>;
		compatible = "marvell,mv64xxx-i2c";
		interrupts = <29>;
		clock-frequency = <100000>;
	};
